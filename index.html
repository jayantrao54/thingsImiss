    <h2>Toys</h2>
    <p>Old stuffed animals, spinning tops, Game Boy, and Tamagotchis – they were more than just toys, they were companions.</p>

  <div class="butter">
    <h2>Places</h2>
    <p>The treehouse in the backyard, grandma’s kitchen, school playground – all full of memories.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="butter">
    <h2>Moments</h2>
    <p>Lazy summer afternoons, birthday parties with balloons, watching cartoons on Saturday mornings.</p>
